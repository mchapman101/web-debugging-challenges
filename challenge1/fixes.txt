This is a report on the bugs I encountered:

1) Index.html: Line 31: 103 -- opening script tag was not closed -- added a > to close it

2) app.js: 1:31 -- Angular dependency "ui Router" was misspelled. Should be 'ui.router'

3) app.js: 3:33 -- added $urlRouterProvider to the ui-router config line

4) app.js 9:10, 11:26, 17:27 -- all .state parameters should have the opening curly bracket "{" inside the first set of round brackets after a comma.

5) app.js 15:9 -- extra set of brackets, moved to line 22 to complete the .config function.

6) productsCtrl 1:88 -- unmatched bracket, added another bracket to line 9 to compensate
